Configuration Notes:
--------------------

* New fisher and oh-my-fish plugins don't seem to be working nicely. If you
  install plugins directly (i.e. `fisher add oh-my-fish/theme-bobthfish$`),
  try downloading from github and then installing from filesystem (i.e.
  `fisher add ~/path-to-package`)
